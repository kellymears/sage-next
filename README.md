# Sage Next

> A static WordPress starter theme built with WPGraphQL and the next.js framework.

**Important note:** while I am on the Roots team, this is not an official Roots project, despite the name. This is just me experimenting and thinking about what some future Sage _could_ look like.

This project can either be used directly as a WordPress theme or -- better yet -- a fully static site generator.

## Requirements

- Node
- WPGraphQL

## Features

- Static site generation and component rehydration
- GraphQL data modeling
- CSS-in-JS theming
- Despite being very opinionated it's really not so opinionated at all.

## Build commands

`yarn dev` starts up an HMR dev server to hack on
`yarn build` compiles the theme and writes the static content to the out dir.
